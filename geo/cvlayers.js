Since the agency’s creation almost 50 years ago, NASA has been a world leader in space-based studies of our home planet. Our mission has always been to explore, to discover, and to understand the world in which we live from the unique vantage point of space, and to share our newly gained perspectives with the public. That spirit of sharing remains true today as NASA operates 18 of the most advanced Earth-observing satellites ever built, helping scientists make some of the most detailed observations ever made of our world.<br><br>In celebration of the ongoing deployment of its Earth Observing System, NASA is pleased to share the newest in its series of stunning Earth images, affectionately named the “Blue Marble: Next Generation.” This new Earth imagery enhances the Blue Marble legacy by providing a detailed look at an entire year in the life of our planet. In sharing these Blue Marble images, NASA hopes the public will join with the agency in its continuing exploration of our world from the unique perspective of space.<br><br>Source: The NASA Earth Observatory.",sourceURL:"http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/intelligent-robotics/planetary/earth/",name:"Blue Marble: Next Generation"},

MODIS measures the temperature of nearly every square kilometer of the Earth’s surface roughly twice a day.<br><br>Unlike conventional observations of surface temperature, which are actually collected by thermometers two meters above the ground, MODIS precisely measures the thermal radiation emitted from the planet’s surface — whether that surface is bare ground, lakes, treetops, or rooftops. This additional detail means farmers can know the temperature of the air around their crops and the temperature of the crops themselves, which helps better estimate things like productivity and water requirements. This data also allows scientists to measure phenomena such as global warming on a planetary scale.<br><br>Source: ICESS, U.C.

Sea surface temperatures influence weather, including hurricanes, as well as plant and animal life in the ocean. Like Earth’s land surface, sea surface temperatures are warmer near the equator and colder near the poles. Currents like giant rivers move warm and cold water around the world’s oceans. Some of these currents flow on the surface, and they are obvious in sea surface temperature images. Special microwave technology allows the AMSR-E sensor on NASA’s Aqua satellite to measure sea surface temperatures through clouds, something no satellite sensor before it was able to do across the whole globe.<br><br>The Aqua AMSR-E is a cooperative effort between NASA and the National Space Development Agency (JAXA) of Japan, with the collaboration of scientific and industry organizations in both countries.

The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one way of measuring these effects. The NDVI is calculated from the visible and near-infrared light reflected by vegetation. It is based on the fact that healthy vegetation absorbs most of the visible light that hits it and reflects a large portion of the near-infrared light, while unhealthy or sparse vegetation reflects more visible light and less near-infrared light.<br><br>The NDVI can be calculated using data from a number of different satellites and sensors.

Yet as important as phytoplankton are to life on Earth, their interaction with our planet has only recently been studied on a global scale.<br><br>To convert sunlight to chemical energy, ocean plants use chlorophyll, the same chemical that gives terrestrial plants their green color. By measuring chlorophyll, NASA satellites can determine the distribution and intensity of phytoplankton in the world’s oceans.
