Like Earth’s land surface, sea surface temperatures are warmer near the equator and colder near the poles. Currents like giant rivers move warm and cold water around the world’s oceans. Some of these currents flow on the surface, and they are obvious in sea surface temperature images. Special microwave technology allows the AMSR-E sensor on NASA’s Aqua satellite to measure sea surface temperatures through clouds, something no satellite sensor before it was able to do across the whole globe.<br><br>The Aqua AMSR-E is a cooperative effort between NASA and the National Space Development Agency (JAXA) of Japan, with the collaboration of scientific and industry organizations in both countries. AMSR-E data are produced by Remote Sensing Systems and sponsored by the NASA Earth Science REASoN DISCOVER Project and the AMSR-E Science Team.<br><br>Source: AMSR-E, Remote Sensing Systems, and the NASA Earth Observatory.","geoJSON":"/geo/data/sat23.geojson"},{"uri":"sat22","name":"Land Vegetation Index","description":"In an effort to monitor major fluctuations in vegetation and understand how they affect the environment, 20 years ago Earth scientists began using satellite remote sensors to measure and map the density of green vegetation over the Earth. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is one way of measuring these effects. The NDVI is calculated from the visible and near-infrared light reflected by vegetation. It is based on the fact that healthy vegetation absorbs most of the visible light that hits it and reflects a large portion of the near-infrared light, while unhealthy or sparse vegetation reflects more visible light and less near-infrared light.<br><br>The NDVI can be calculated using data from a number of different satellites and sensors.
